# Take Home Task

### Problem

We have some customer records in a text file (customers.txt) -- one customer per line, JSON lines formatted. We want to invite any customer within 100km of our Dublin office for some food and drinks on us. Write a program that will read the full list of customers and output the names and user ids of matching customers (within 100km), sorted by User ID (ascending).

* You must use the first formula from this [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great-circle_distance) article to calculate distance. Don't forget, you'll need to convert degrees to radians.

* The GPS coordinates for our Dublin office are 53.339428, -6.257664.

* You can find the Customer list [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/intercom-take-home-test/customers.txt).

We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program. Good submissions are well composed. Calculating distances and reading from a file are separate concerns. Classes or functions have clearly defined responsibilities.  Poor submissions will be in the form of one big function. Itâ€™s impossible to test anything smaller than the entire operation of the program, including reading from the input file.

### Requirements

Node >= v10 
Jest >= v24

### Config
  
* TARGET_LOCATION_LATITUDE - target latitude, Dublin Office by default
* TARGET_LOCATION_LONGITUDE - target longitude, Dublin Office by default
* PATH_TO_CUSTOMERS_FILE" - path to file with customers records
